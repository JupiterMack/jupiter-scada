"""
Jupiter SCADA Test Suite Package.

This package contains all the tests for the `jupiter_scada` application.
The tests are organized into sub-modules, typically mirroring the structure
of the main application source code.

This includes:
- Unit tests for individual components (e.g., models, configuration).
- Integration tests for interactions between components (e.g., API and OPC UA client).
- End-to-end tests for the complete application flow.

Running the tests can be done using a test runner like `pytest` from the
project's root directory.
